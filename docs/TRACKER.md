**Current phase:** Phase 2 — Sport Foundation

---

## Current Repo State

- Project scaffold and package layout exist
- Local Docker Compose exists for `betbot` and `betbot-postgres`
- `cmd/server` now runs a Fiber operational surface backed by pgxpool reads
- `cmd/worker`, core migrations, odds polling, and operational views are now wired for the completed Phase 1 slice
- `internal/store` is now generated from `sqlc` query sources and used by the app surface
- `internal/domain` now exposes a concrete `SportConfig` registry for MLB/NBA/NHL/NFL
- Worker scheduling now filters odds polling to sports active in the current season
- Minimal sport-stat schema is now live: team tables for MLB/NBA/NHL/NFL plus MLB pitcher, NHL goalie, and NFL QB foundations
- MLB stats ETL now has a live MLB Stats API provider, explicit River enqueue path, and sqlc-backed team and pitcher upserts
- NBA stats ETL now has a live stats.nba.com provider path, explicit River enqueue helper, and idempotent nba_team_stats upserts
- Phase 1 integration coverage now includes insert/dedup behavior and Postgres 17 boot smoke
- NHL stats ETL now has a first-pass live team path via the official NHL web API; goalie writes remain deferred pending a date-consistent goalie source
- Documentation is now aligned to the four-sport direction: `MLB`, `NBA`, `NHL`, `NFL`

The current implementation target is intentionally narrower than the full product architecture. Phase 2 is now extending that ingestion slice into tightly scoped sport-specific ETL foundations before broader modeling breadth.

## Phase 1 — Data Foundation Vertical Slice

Goal: ship a working ingestion slice with PostgreSQL 17, `pgxpool`, `sqlc`, River, The Odds API polling, append-only odds storage, and minimal Fiber operational visibility.

Phase 1 exit criteria:

- Fiber operational views read from persisted data
- Postgres 17 + `pgxpool` + River + `sqlc` are the live baseline

Out of scope for Phase 1:

- sport-specific stats ETL
- injury/lineup/weather ingestion
- model execution
- CLV automation
- execution adapters
